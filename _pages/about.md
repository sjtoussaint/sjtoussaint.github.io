Welcome to my website! I obtained my PhD in economics in 2025 at the Utrecht University, supervised by [Coen Teulings](https://www.coenteulings.com/) and [Bas van Bavel](https://www.uu.nl/staff/bjpvanbavel). Since August 2025, I work at Leiden University as Wetenschappelijk Docent (Senior Lecturer).

I study the dynamics of wealth concentration. My main research fields are Macroeconomics and Finance; I also have interests in Public Finance and Economic History. I am a fellow of the [World Inequality Database](https://wid.world/).

You can find my CV <a href="/assets/pdf/cv_toussaint.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>.\
