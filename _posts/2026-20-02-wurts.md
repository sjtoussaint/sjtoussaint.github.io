This is the first of (potentially several) blog posts, in which I reflect on things that strike my fancy. One goal in particular will be to connect two passions of mine, economics and fantasy literature. In this first post, I reflect on Janny Wurts' <strong>The Wars of Light and Shadow</strong> (WoLaS from now on). I recently finished the final book, <i>Song of the Mysteries</i>, after restarting reading the series somewhere last year.

<strong> Spoilers from now on, be warned! </strong>

## Summary

tWoLaS is an 11-book cycle mainly taking place on the planet of Athera, with main continent Paravia. This is a planet that (we learn throughout the books) has not originally been inhabited by humans; instead, it was first populated by dragons and later also by three special races called Paravians: unicorns, centaurs, and sunchildren. The Paravians are the centerpiece of this world's history, for they were sent directly by Ath (God, if you will) to bring grace to the world. You see, these dragons had the nasty habit of running amok with their creative magic, which led to countless horrors and destructions, foremost among them several genocidal nightmare races destroying every living thing.

An interesting feature of the setting is that, while it on first glance looks medieval, it is in fact a sci-fi setting. The prime human movers, the seven super-powerful sorcerers known as the Fellowship of the Seven, arrive on Athera over 10,000 years before the books start. Their arrival is caused by the dragons, who magically pull their spaceship on collision course, and subsequently transform these humans into immortal creatures with mind-boggling power. Their task? To use that power to protect Paravian survival at all cost.

And so they do. Over thousands of years, they hunt the drakespawn to extinction. Interestingly, when the dragon imperative doesn't bind them, they commit themselves to the Law of the Major Balance: a Paravian concept where no "no force of nature should be used without consent, or against the will of another living being". Throughout the books, we see the sorcerers ask permission of every sentient being before engaging their power. In Wurts' vision, not only humans or animals have sentience; so do plants and even inanimate matter. All that is, vibrates; consent is aligning the frequency of what you do to be in harmony with a being's core resonance. Here we see Wurts' devotion to music, something I will return to.
