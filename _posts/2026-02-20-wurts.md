This is the first of (potentially several) blog posts, in which I reflect on things that strike my fancy. One goal in particular will be to connect two passions of mine, economics and fantasy literature. In this first post, I reflect on Janny Wurts' <strong>The Wars of Light and Shadow</strong> (WoLaS from now on). I recently finished the final book, <i>Song of the Mysteries</i>, after restarting reading the series somewhere last year.
